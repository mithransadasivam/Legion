## Sim-to-real transfer for legged locomotion
Source: Example et al., 2021 -- arXiv:2100.00001
Keywords: locomotion, sim-to-real, reinforcement learning, quadruped

Policies trained in simulation with randomized dynamics transferred to a real quadruped robot
without further tuning, walking over uneven terrain. The gap between simulated and real-world
friction remained the largest source of failure, and the result hasn't been replicated on
bipedal platforms.

## Swarm coordination without central control
Source: Example & Someone, 2019 -- arXiv:1900.00002
Keywords: swarm robotics, decentralized control, emergent behavior

A colony of simple robots reached consensus on a shared task using only local communication,
with no central coordinator. Scaling past a few hundred units introduces communication delays
that haven't yet been solved.

_MEDICINE_MD = """\
## CRISPR base editing without double-strand breaks
Source: Researcher et al., 2022 -- PMID:1234567
Keywords: crispr, base editing, gene editing, dna repair

Base editors convert one DNA base to another directly, without cutting both strands of the
double helix. This avoids the unpredictable insertions and deletions double-strand breaks can
cause, though off-target editing at similar sequences elsewhere in the genome is still measurable
and not fully solved.
