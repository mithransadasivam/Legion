"""Retrieval by meaning, over Legion's curated research notes and whatever the user drops into
their own library folder.

Keyword matching (legion/research.py) can't tell that "heart attack" and "myocardial infarction"
are the same thing; embeddings can. Each passage is turned into a vector by a small free model
running in Ollama (nomic-embed-text), the question gets the same treatment, and the passages
whose vectors point the most nearly the same way are the ones handed to the model.

The expensive part -- embedding every passage -- happens once, in the background, and is cached on
disk keyed by each file's size and modification time, so restarting Legion costs nothing and only
files that are new or changed are ever embedded again. Until the first index exists, or whenever
Ollama can't produce embeddings, questions fall back to the keyword search instead of failing.
