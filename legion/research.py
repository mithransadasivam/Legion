"""Retrieval over a small local library of research notes, so domain questions (robotics,
medicine, CRISPR and gene editing) get answered from real papers instead of just whatever the
model half-remembers from training.

Not full papers, and not verbatim excerpts: each entry in legion/knowledge/*.md is a short,
Legion-authored summary of one paper's key finding, with a citation for provenance -- readable in
a spoken reply, and clear of the copyright question a wholesale copy of the source text would
raise.

No embeddings, no vector database: with a few dozen entries, plain keyword overlap between the
question and each entry's keywords, title, and body is both fast enough and precise enough, and
it keeps this free of a multi-gigabyte embedding-model dependency for a personal voice assistant.
