"""Hands-free activation: wait for speech, then record until the user stops talking.

Two ways to decide someone's actually talking to Legion. A trained model from openWakeWord listens
for one specific phrase before recording starts at all -- it ships a ready-made "hey jarvis", and a
custom phrase such as "hey legion" is a single .onnx file, trained with its own notebook and passed
in place of the name. Or, with no model at all (``model=None``), anyone starting to speak is recorded
and handed to legion.greeting to check afterwards -- see that module for why. Either way, with no
second key press to mark the end of a command, the Silero voice activity detector that ships
alongside openWakeWord decides when the user has stopped talking.
