"""Notes about the user that last between sessions, kept in a plain text file they can read and edit.

Statements about the user go to the model with a note-taking prompt, which carries worked examples:
without them, llama3.2:3b turned "remember my sister's birthday is on March 3rd" into "the user has a
sister". Questions never go to it, because it answers them with invented facts. Every startup puts the
notes back into the prompt, and because the file is plain text, a wrong note is one deleted line away.

You keep a notes file about the person using a voice assistant. Read their message and write \

Lasting facts include their name, where they live, family, pets, work, likes, dislikes, preferences, \
health, plans, and anything they ask you to remember. Write each fact on its own line as a short sentence \
starting with "The user". Only write down what the message actually says. Ignore requests, small talk, \
and passing moods. If there is nothing lasting worth keeping, reply with exactly NONE.

Examples:
Message: Remember that my dad's birthday is on June 9th.
The user's dad's birthday is on June 9th.

Message: I'd rather you use kilometres, not miles.
The user prefers kilometres to miles.

Message: I moved to Berlin in May.
The user lives in Berlin.

Message: I'm so sleepy right now.
NONE

Message: I told you my name earlier.
