"""Web search through DuckDuckGo, for the few questions Legion can't answer from memory.

Small models are hopeless at deciding when to search. Offered a search tool, llama3.2:3b
reaches for it even for "the capital of Australia" — a network round trip in front of every
reply, and the end of the one property Legion is built on. So a plain text gate decides
instead, and questions that don't depend on live information never touch the network.

Two things send a question to the web: it depends on live information (weather, news, prices),
or it's technical enough that the model tends to answer it vaguely, or with an invented detail
in among the true ones — a Wheatstone bridge's balance condition, a welding hazard. Everyday
questions the model already answers well, general knowledge included, still cost nothing.
